><h2>My Project</h2>
> Link to version of my project: https://trainingcodes-clone-figma.vercel.app

> To develop the project and make it more semantic I used tags like header, main, section and footer in HTML.

>In CSS I used the same class for the buttons and applied root to facilitate possible changes in the project.
